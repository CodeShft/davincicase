## Project Description

This project was built using Vite as the development environment for fast and efficient setup, together with React to create a reusable component-based UI. Data is fetched and managed from the JSONPlaceholder API
using React Query, while React Router DOM is used to enable smooth navigation between pages such as Homepage, Users, and Posts.

For the UI, TailwindCSS was applied to achieve a modern and responsive design, supported by PostCSS and Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility. Global and filter state management is handled with Zustand, and Lodash utilities were included to simplify complex operations and improve code readability.

Additionally, the project uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainability, while ESLint and Prettier were configured to enforce consistent formatting and catch potential issues automatically.
